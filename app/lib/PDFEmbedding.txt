step-by-step explanation of the workflow for embedding a PDF into Pinecone:

Step 1: Initialize Pinecone Client
File: app/lib/pinecone-client.ts
Function: getPinecone
This function checks if a Pinecone client instance (pineconeInstance) already exists.
If not, it calls initPinecone to initialize a new Pinecone client.
The initPinecone function:
Creates a new Pinecone client using the API key from the environment variables.
Checks if the specified index exists.
If the index does not exist, it calls createIndex to create it.
Returns the initialized Pinecone client.

Step 2: Chunk the PDF Document
File: app/lib/pdf-loader.ts
Function: getChunkedDocsFromPDF
This function loads the PDF document specified in the environment variable PDF_PATH.
It uses a text splitter to divide the document into smaller chunks.
Returns the chunked documents.

Step 3: Embed and Store the Chunks in Pinecone
File: app/lib/vector-store.ts
Function: embedAndStoreDocs
This function takes the Pinecone client and the chunked documents as input.
It creates embeddings for the chunked documents using the OpenAI embeddings model.
Stores these embeddings in the Pinecone index.

Step 4: Execute the Workflow
File: app/scripts/pinecone-embed-docs.ts
This script orchestrates the entire workflow.
It calls getPinecone to initialize the Pinecone client.
Calls getChunkedDocsFromPDF to chunk the PDF document.
Calls embedAndStoreDocs to embed and store the chunks in Pinecone.
